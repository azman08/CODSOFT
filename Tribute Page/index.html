        "I'm the best ever. I'm the most brutal and vicious, the most ruthless
        champion there has ever been. There's no one can stop me. Lennox is a
        conqueror? No! He's no Alexander! I'm Alexander! I'm the best ever. I'm
        Sonny Liston. I'm Jack Dempsey. There's never been anyone like me. I'm
        from their cloth. There is no one who can match me. My style is
        impetuous, my defense is impregnable, and I'm just ferocious. I want
        your heart! I want to eat his children! Praise be to Allah!" ~Mike Tyson
